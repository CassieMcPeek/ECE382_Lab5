# Lab 5 - Interrupts - "Remote Control Decoding"

# Purpose
  In this lab, we used our knowledge of interrupts and the Timer_A subsystem to reverse engineer a remote control. We used the timer interrupt and the general purpose pin interrupt to decode a remote control. The purpose of 
  day 1 was to learn the timing and bit patterns of our remote controls. Day 2, we were to demonstrate that our code can receive and decode button presses from our remote controls. Day 3 we were to implement either our etch-a-sketch or pong game. I utilize remote 5 for this lab.
  
  
# Day 1
1. 	How long will it take the timer to roll over? 
	
	(0xFFF cnts)/rollover*  (8 clks)/(1 cnt)*  (1 us)/(8 clks)   = 0xFFFF us/rollover

2. 	How long does each timer count last?

	(1 cnt)/1*  (8 clks)/(1 cnt)*  (1 us)/(8 clks) = 1 cnt = 1 us

The while(1) loop in main reads in the ir pules in the for loop. 
Annotate the picture below to indicate which line of the for loop in the program is executed at which part of the pulse. You should show a total of 6 lines of code (lines 32-34 and lines 36-38).

List the lengths of the pulses generated by the remote control in absolute time using the O'scope (3 significant figures) and in timer A counts. Note: "start logic 0 half-pulse" refers to the logic LOW portion of the start pulse, and "data 0 logic 1 half pulse" refers to the second half (which is a logic HIGH) of the pulse representing a zero bit.

Collect and tabulate in Excel 8 samples of timer A counts for each of the following pulse types (in decimal). Compute the average and standard deviation of each pulse type. I would suggest just grabbing it from the CCS variables tab.
- Data 1, logic 1 half-pulse - Data 0, logic 0 half-pulse - Data 0, logic 1 half-pulse
Ensure you label the rows and columns of your table so that I will know what the information in each cell means.

 For each pulse type list the range of timer A counts that would correctly classify 99.9999426697% of the pulses. This number has something to do with the standard deviation (hint: look at the table in this section).
The count would that would classify 99.9999426697% of the pulses would be two standard deviations.

	Data 1 Logic 1 range = (1594.5  to 1732.3)
	Data 0 Logic 0 range = (505.6 to 601.1)
	Data 0 Logic 1 range = (560.2 to 591.8)
	
Write the codes (in hex) for several remote control buttons.
